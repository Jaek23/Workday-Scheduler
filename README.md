# Workday Scheduler 
Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project was created to practice writing JavaScript in JQuery. This project focused on utilizing the correct classes and IDs to make the workday calendar fully functional and how to apply listeners and If conditionals through JQuery. 

## Usage 
When you open the workday calendar, the current date will be displayed on the top of the page below the header and will update each day you open the website. There will also be time blocks listed where the user can type in what they need to accomplish by different time frames. The user will also be able to save their information to local storage when they click the save button next to each time block so when they reload the page the information the user has put in the time blocks will stay on there until deleted. The time blocks are also color-coded so that when the time block has passed, the color will be grey, when the time block is in its current hour it will show as red and if it's in the future it will show as green.
